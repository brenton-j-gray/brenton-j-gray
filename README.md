# Brenton Gray
**Software Engineer | Computer Science Fundamentals | Cloud & Gaming Infrastructure Curious**

I’m a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a preference for building clean, reliable systems that hold up under real-world constraints. I’m currently part of the Microsoft Hiring Our Heroes fellowship, working alongside engineers in Azure Core and continuing to level up in large-scale cloud platforms and distributed systems.

I care about correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability. I enjoy writing code that the next engineer can understand at a glance, not just code that satisfies the compiler. My approach is iterative: build something solid, learn from feedback, improve it, and repeat. Attention to detail, perseverance, and emotional intelligence matter just as much to me as technical accuracy when building production systems.

I’m especially interested in the intersection of **cloud infrastructure, scalable services, and gaming platforms**. The invisible systems that make gameplay feel effortless.

## Projects & Code (Honest Take)

My repositories focus primarily on **foundational software engineering skills and practical implementations** rather than production-hardened systems. They reflect how I think, how I approach problems, and how I write maintainable code,not finalized enterprise-scale solutions.

### Strengths You’ll See
- Clear demonstrations of core CS concepts (algorithms, validation logic, data modeling)
- Multi-language experience across C++, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases
- Readable, approachable code with an emphasis on correctness and edge cases
- End-to-end thinking in full-stack projects (UI, backend logic, and persistence)

Examples:
- **Credit Card Number Validator (C++)**  
  A clean implementation of the Luhn algorithm with input validation and card-type identification. This project intentionally emphasizes correctness, edge handling, and translating an algorithm into maintainable code.

- **Full‑Stack Projects (Movie Database, WasteNot, Tennis League)**  
  These demonstrate comfort with CRUD workflows, relational and non-relational data stores, basic API design, and real-world data constraints. I focused on making the systems functional and understandable before optimizing prematurely.

- **Portfolio Website**  
  A pragmatic project that uses the GitHub API to dynamically display repositories. It prioritizes function over flash and shows comfort working with external APIs and client-side logic.

### Gaps I’m Actively Aware Of
- Most projects are **educational or exploratory**, not production-hardened services
- Limited use of automated testing frameworks
- No real-world scale testing, performance benchmarking, or long-term refactor history
- Minimal observability, hardening, or deployment patterns

These gaps are intentional trade-offs given the scope of individual projects,and they’re also the areas I’m actively building toward as I gain deeper exposure to large-scale cloud and platform systems.

## Why This Matters

If you’re reviewing this as a recruiter or engineer, my code shows **how I think**, not just what I know. It reflects comfort with fundamentals, ownership of decisions, and a growth mindset toward more complex, distributed systems, which is exactly where I want to spend the next phase of my engineering career.

I’m a lifelong gamer, but my interest is technical: backend services, streaming platforms, performance optimization, and the systems that make modern gaming seamless at scale.
